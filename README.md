# Redesign - Paprika Mobile Pantry

# Overview

With summer coming to an end and the school term starting soon I started looking and collecting interesting recipes I'd like to try for when I'm living away from family. Initially, I had the idea of designing an app that allowed you to collect your recipes, plan them throughout the week and create shopping lists for the groceries that would be needed for the week. After some product research I came to discover the ever so popular 'Paprika' (paprikaapp.com). Upon reading reviews this seemed to be highly regarded with the most features and happy customer reviews. Boasting an overage score of 4.7/5 from over 5000 reviews across both mobile and desktop platforms. 

# Paprika Recipe Manager

Paprika is an cross-platform app centered around recipe management with features for grocery shopping, meal planning, pantry tracking and more. With the option to upgrade for cloud sync features, the success of the app lends itself to the plethora of features it offers users.

# Research

how many meals do you have a day?

how many meals do you plan ahead of time? 

ideas: update from meal planner, favourites/important restocking

Using the application first hand and going through app reviews, the pantry tracking feature felt lacking to the overall user experience of the app. Unlike features such as the meal planning and grocery list that work hand in hand, the pantry felt disconnected from the rest of the features as there was no way to update the quantities in the pantry as they are used up in meals.

# Exploration

The pantry integration is limited to interactions with the grocery list which allow users to quickly add items back and forth between the two listings with the option for moving only purchased, expired, or out of stock items to the other list.

It was nice to see that the a search feature was recently added as per user request. 

![Redesign%20-%20Paprika%20Mobile%20Pantry%2056d9899791284aa8b946a86941c112bd/Screenshot_20200908-115130.png](Redesign%20-%20Paprika%20Mobile%20Pantry%2056d9899791284aa8b946a86941c112bd/Screenshot_20200908-115130.png)

Another thing was the grocery list stores quantities information but when moving items from grocery to pantry, the quantities get lost and the field is empty. 

![Redesign%20-%20Paprika%20Mobile%20Pantry%2056d9899791284aa8b946a86941c112bd/Untitled%2019.png](Redesign%20-%20Paprika%20Mobile%20Pantry%2056d9899791284aa8b946a86941c112bd/Untitled%2019.png)

Something I experienced was lacking was any way to update ingredients in the pantry as they are consumed in recipes. This shows the disconnect the pantry feature has with other parts of the app and it leaves the user to manually update the ingredients which is time consuming when recipes get more and more complex.

By mapping out the basic tasks tied to the pantry we can break down their steps and further observe the different features that make up the pantry. Immediately we can see some complex tasks with many steps. Keep in mind, each of the features broken down above perform add/remove/update. Assuming the tasks take the same amount of effort/ time. Right off the bat, we can see the simplest task was updating a pantry entry and the most complex task was adding pantry entries.

# Proto-Personas

in order to further understand the app's users, I developed proto-personas to embody the apps primary users. I ended up with two personas, one using it for personal lifestyle - keeping track of meals, food consumption etc. The second relying on the app for their job (working in the food industry).

- student, meal plans, goes shopping with roommates
- restaurant chef, needs to keep track of large inventory

why persona? what information are you trying to gather? why would this be a value to them? try to reach out

survey, and test with people so you can measure its success and talk about why

think about what you're trying to answer and try to find that answer
